Insertion sort is based on the idea that one element from the input elements is consumed in each iteration to find its correct position.
The first element in the array is assumed to be sorted. The second element is taken and stored in amemory location called "key". 
The "key" is compared with the first element. If the first element is 
greater than "key", then key is palced in fron the first elememt.The third element in the array is compared with the elements on the left.
If there is no element smallest than it, then it is placed at the beginning of the array. The iteration occurs until the elements are 
accurately sorted.
Thus, in the worst case, each element is compared with the all the other elements in the sorted array. For n elements, there will be 
n^2 comparisons. Therefore, the time complesity is O(n^2).
